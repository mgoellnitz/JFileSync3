		<h1>Available Views</h1>
		<p>The default view displays files and directories that will have to be 
			copied or deleted according to the chosen <a 
			href="JFSSyncModes.html">synchronization mode</a>. However, you may 
			also view all compared files or only a certain sub-set of 
			them. The following views are supported by JFileSync:</p>
		<h2>All Files</h2>
		<p>Views all files and directories that have been analyzed during 
			comparison, even if they don't have to be copied or deleted to 
			perform the synchronization.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this view is <code>20</code> when using it from 
			the command line.</p>
		<h2>Files to Copy or Delete</h2>
		<p>Views only files and directories that will have to be copied or 
			deleted according to the chosen synchronization mode or for which 
			the user has to be asked in order to perform the synchronization. 
			This includes files and directories that have to be copied or 
			deleted, or have an inconsistent file length, or are not part of 
			the synchronization history, or contradict the information stored 
			in the synchronization history. The latter two holds when a 
			history-based synchronization mode is chosen.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this view is <code>21</code> when using it from 
			the command line.</p>
		<h2>Source Files to Copy or Delete</h2>
		<p>Views only files and directories on the source side that will have 
			to be copied or deleted according to the chosen synchronization 
			mode or for which the user has to be asked in order to perform the 
			synchronization. This includes files and directories that have to 
			be copied or deleted, or have an inconsistent file length, or are 
			not part of the synchronization history, or contradict the 
			information stored in the synchronization history. The latter two 
			holds when a history-based synchronization mode is chosen.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this view is <code>22</code> when using it from 
			the command line.</p>
		<h2>Target Files to Copy or Delete</h2>
		<p>Views only files and directories on the target side that will have 
			to be copied or deleted according to the chosen synchronization 
			mode or for which the user has to be asked in order to perform the 
			synchronization. This includes files and directories that have to 
			be copied or deleted, or have an inconsistent file length, or are 
			not part of the synchronization history, or contradict the 
			information stored in the synchronization history. The latter two 
			holds when a history-based synchronization mode is chosen.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this view is <code>23</code> when using it from 
			the command line.</p>
		<h2>Files to Copy</h2>
		<p>Views only files and directories that will have to be copied 
			according to the chosen synchronization mode or for which the user 
			has to be asked in order to perform the synchronization. 
			This includes files and directories that have to be copied, or have 
			an inconsistent file length, or are not part of the synchronization 
			history, or contradict the information stored in the 
			synchronization history. The latter two holds when a history-based 
			synchronization mode is chosen.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this view is <code>24</code> when using it from 
			the command line.</p>
		<h2>Files to Delete</h2>
		<p>Views only files and directories that will have to be deleted 
			according to the chosen synchronization mode or for which the user 
			has to be asked in order to perform the synchronization. 
			This includes files and directories that have to be deleted, or 
			have an inconsistent file length, or are not part of the 
			synchronization history, or contradict the information stored in 
			the synchronization history. The latter two holds when a 
			history-based synchronization mode is chosen.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this view is <code>25</code> when using it from 
			the command line.</p>
		<h2>Ambiguous Files</h2>
		<p>Views only files and directories for which the user has to be asked 
			in order to perform the synchronization. This includes files and 
			directories that have an inconsistent file length, or are not part 
			of the synchronization history, or contradict the information 
			stored in the synchronization history. The latter two holds when a 
			history-based synchronization mode is chosen.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this view is <code>26</code> when using it from 
			the command line.</p>
