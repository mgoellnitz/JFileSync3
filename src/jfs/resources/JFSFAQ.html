		<h2><a name="regexp"></a>How can I specify files to include and
			exclude using regular expressions?</h2>
		<p>In order to specify files or directories to include and/or
			exclude from comparison and synchronization, you have to
			specify a so called regular expression, which is matched with
			the names of files and directories.</p>
		<p>Note that the regular expression is not matched with the
			complete path of a file or directory. For instance, if you have a
			file called <code>C:\Documents\Test\Test.txt</code> the
			expression will only be matched with <code>Test.txt</code>.</p>
		<p>You may find an introduction to regular expressions in
			<i>http://www.regular-expressions.info</i>. The
			following list presents some typical examples for exclude and
			include patterns.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>.*\.bak</code> will match all file names ending
				with <code>.bak</code>.</li>
			<li><code>.*My Music.*</code> will match all file names
				including the words <code>My Music</code>.</li>
			<li><code>CVS</code> will match all file names exactly
				matching the word <code>CVS</code>.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2><a name="timeout"></a>When using a JFS server, the log file
			tells me something about timeouts. What can I do?</h2>
		<p>When using a JFS server, the default timeout is set to 5 seconds.
			Using a slow connection to the JFS server (e.g., via modem) may
			cause a lot of timeouts during synchronization. Therefore,
			you should increase the timeout (via the JFS server
			properties) to at least a minute (3.600.000 ms) before
			starting synchronization.</p>
		
		<h2><a name="mem"></a>What to do, if Java reports too less
			memory?</h2>
		<p>If you compare a lot of different files at once, it may happen that
			the Java virtual machine is out of memory. In this case, you
			should restart the program like:</p>
		<p><code>java -Xmx256m -jar jfs.jar</code></p>
		<p>The parameter <code>-Xmx256</code> will increase the maximum
			heap size to 256 MB. You may also add this parameter to one of the
			starting scripts (e.g., <code>JFileSync.bat</code> for
			Windows systems).</p>
		
		<h2><a name="script"></a>How to use JFS as part of
			synchronization scripts?</h2>
		<p>JFS can be controlled via the <a
				href="JFSCmdLineOptions.txt">command line</a>.
			Normally, the JFS <a href="JFSShellOptions.txt">command
			line shell</a> is started, when specifying the
			<code>-nogui</code> option. In this case, JFS performs an
			interactive synchronization via the shell; that is, you can
			have a look at the comparison table, specify synchronization
			modes, answer questions about files that may not be
			automatically synchronized, and so on. When using the
			<code>-quiet</code> option, every operation is performed in
			background without user interaction. This means that files
			that may not automatically be synchronized (e.g., because of
			an inconsistent time stamp) will be skipped during
			synchronization.</p>
		<p>Assuming that you specified your directory pairs,
			synchronization mode, and other profile settings in file
			<code>MyProfile.xml</code> the JFS call as part of a
			synchronization script may look like follows:</p>
		<p><code>java -jar jfs.jar -config MyProfile.xml -nogui
			-quiet</code></p>
		
		<h2><a name="lang"></a>Is it possible to change language and
			region settings?</h2>
		<p>Yes, it is. By default JFS uses the system defaults of your user.
			If the selected language and region of your user is not English
			US, which is the only currently supported language and region,
			some dialog elements that are provided by the Java Swing User
			Interface will be displayed according to the chosen system
			language and region. This holds, for instance, for the file
			chooser dialogs or the display of time stamps. You may change
			this behavior by specifying some Java properties when the
			application is started.</p>
		<p>If you want a special locale (language and region), like de_DE
			(German, Germany), you may call JFS as follows:</p>
		<p><code>java -Duser.language=de -Duser.region=DE -jar
			jfs.jar</code></p>
		<p>The parameter <code>-Duser.language=de</code> will set the
			used language for the Java virtual machine to <code>de</code>
			and the parameter <code>-Duser.region=DE</code> will set
			the used region to <code>DE</code>. You may also add this
			parameter to one of the starting scripts (e.g.,
			<code>JFileSync.bat</code> for Windows systems).</p>
		
		<h2><a name="laf"></a>Can I change the look and feel?</h2>
		<p>Yes, you can. By default the system look and feels are used for
			each Java platform. You may specify a specific look and feel,
			like JGoodies Plastic XP (see <i>jgoodies.com</i>), as
			follows:</p>
		<p><code>java -cp lib\jfs.jar;lib\looks-1.3.jar
			jfs.JFileSync -laf
			com.jgoodies.looks.plastic.PlasticXPLookAndFeel</code>
			</p>
		<p>The Java parameter <code>-cp
			lib\jfs.jar;lib\looks-1.3.jar</code> specified the
			location of the JFS library and the JGoodies library
			containing the look and feel you want to use. The JFS parameter
			<code>-laf
			com.jgoodies.looks.plastic.PlasticXPLookAndFeel</code>
			specified the class in the JGoodies library that represents
			the look and feel you want to use.</p>
		<p>Please note that the look and feel class specified by the
			<code>-laf</code> option is stored in the JFS configuration
			file (as part of the JFS configuration directory of your home
			directory). So, you only have to call JFS for the first time
			including the <code>-laf</code> option. After the first
			application start, you may use the following call in order to
			start JFS with the previously chosen look and feel:</p>
		<p><code>java -cp lib\jfs.jar;lib\looks-1.3.jar
			jfs.JFileSync</code></p>
		<p>You may also add this parameter to one of the starting scripts
			(e.g., <code>JFileSync.bat</code> for Windows
			systems).</p>
		
		<h2><a name="i18n"></a>How to add translations to JFS?</h2>
		<p>JFS has a quite simple internationalization mechanism. Let us
			assume, we want to add a German translation for JFS. You may add
			the new language for the command line and graphical user
			interface by following the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Download the JFS development version.</li>
			<li>Copy file <code>JFSTranslation.properties</code> in
				directory <code>src/jfs/resources/conf</code> to
				<code>JFSTranslations_de_DE.properties</code> in
				order to get a template of all key words that have to be
				translated.</li>
			<li>Translate all values for all keys in the copied file.</li>
			<li>Call <code>ant</code> in order to create a new JFS
				build.</li>
			<li>Start JFS with the newly added language and region in order
				to check your translations: <code>java
				-Duser.language=de -Duser.region=DE -jar
				lib/jfs.jar</code>.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You may also add translations for the help files and command line
			help text files by following the following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Download the JFS development version.</li>
			<li>Copy file <code>JFSConfig.properties</code> in
				directory <code>src/jfs/resources/conf</code> to
				<code>JFSConfig_de_DE.properties</code> in order to
				get a copy of the main configuration for the locale
				(language and region) we want to add.</li>
			<li>Copy the file you want to translate from the directory
				<code>src/jfs/resources</code> to the same directory
				and add <code>_de_DE</code> to the file name (before the
				file extension), like:
				<code>JFSFAQ_de_DE.html</code>.</li>
			<li>Translate all text in the copied file.</li>
			<li>Change the keys of the file
				<code>JFSConfig_de_DE.properties</code>
				accordingly, so that the newly translated file is
				referenced, like <code>HELP_FAQ =
				JFSFAQ_de_DE.html</code>. The mechanism is quite
				general; you may even localize the used graphics.</li>
			<li>Call <code>ant</code> in order to create a new JFS
				build.</li>
			<li>Start JFS with the newly added language and region in order
				to check your translations: <code>java
				-Duser.language=de -Duser.region=DE -jar
				lib/jfs.jar</code>.</li>
		</ol>
