		<h1>What is JFileSync?</h1>
		<p>JFileSync is used to synchronize pairs of directories. For
			instance, if you want to ensure that a certain set of files
			located on your workstation matches a corresponding set on
			your laptop or an external data drive.</p>
		<p>In order to synchronize directories, you basically have to
			perform the three following steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><img src="icons/Profile.gif" alt="JFS"></img>&nbsp;
				Define a <a href="JFSProfile.html">synchronization
				profile</a> including the directory pairs you would like
				to synchronize.</li>
			<li><img src="icons/Compare.gif" alt="JFS"></img>&nbsp;
				Perform a comparison of all specified directory pairs in
				your synchronization profile. The results are presented
				in the center of the main window. The column labeled with
				<i>A</i> (for <i>action</i>) shows icons representing
				the actions that would have to be performed in order to
				synchronize the directories. That means, whether to copy
				a file or directory, delete it, or the user has to be asked in
				order to determine the right action (e.g., in case of
				inconsistent file lengths or time stamps).</li>
			<li><img src="icons/Synchronize.gif" alt="JFS"></img>
				&nbsp; Start the synchronization of all specified
				directory pairs in your synchronization profile. A
				dialog appears showing all files and directories that
				will have to be copied (and deleted). After confirming the
				lists of copy and delete statements (or selecting a
				special subset of them), the synchronization will be
				performed accordingly.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You may save <img src="icons/Save.gif" alt="JFS"></img> and
			load <img src="icons/Open.gif" alt="JFS"></img> your
			specified synchronization profiles.</p>
		<p>JFileSync provides several <a href="JFSSyncModes.html">
			synchronization modes</a>. The default setting uses the
			automatic mode that will use the history of synchronized files
			in order to determine whether a file should be copied or has to be
			deleted. However, you may also force JFileSync to create an
			exact copy of one file system ignoring whether a file on one side
			is newer than its corresponding file.</p>
		<p>JFileSync provides several <a href="JFSViews.html">
			views</a> on the presented list of analyzed files. Usually
			only files that have to be modified in some way (e.g., copied or
			deleted) are viewed. But you may also view all analyzed files or
			other certain sub-sets.</p>
		<p>The complete JFileSync functionality can be controlled via the
			provided graphical user interface as well as the command line.
			If you are using JFileSync from the command line, several <a
				href="JFSCmdLineOptions.txt">command line
			options</a> are provided (also available when calling
			<code>java -jar jfs.jar -help</code> from a command shell).
			You may then perform synchronizations interactively using
			the build-in <a href="JFSShellOptions.txt">JFS shell</a>
			or in a script-like manner using the <code>-quiet</code>
			option.</p>
		<p>JFileSync also provides a couple of plug-ins which enhance the
			functionality with respect to time stamp correction (e.g.,
			when having problems switching from winter to summer time) or
			detection of read-only files.</p>
		<p>JFileSync is an open source project provided under the <a
				href="JFSLicense.html">GNU General Public
			License</a>. It is hosted on SourceForge:
