		<h1>Synchronization Profile</h1>
		<p>The synchronization profile <img src="icons/Profile.gif"
				alt="JFS"/> includes all application settings
			that are relevant for synchronizing a set of specified
			directory pairs. You may save <img src="icons/Save.gif"
				alt="JFS"/> and load <img src="icons/Open.gif"
				alt="JFS"/> specified synchronization profiles.
			You can change all listed options via the profile management
			dialog available via the JFileSync main frame. A single
			profile is separated into three different parts:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Basic settings for synchronization including the
				synchronization mode and the directory pairs you want to
				synchronize.</li>
			<li>Advanced settings including the granularity for
				comparing the time stamps of two files.</li>
			<li>Files and directories to include and exclude from
				synchronization.</li>
			<li>Server settings including the port, pass phrase, user 
			    name and so one using the profile with a back end 
			    server.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Basic Settings</h2>
		<p>In the following we give an overview of basic profile settings.
			These options should be defined once for each set of directory
			pairs you want to synchronize together.</p>
		<p>(B1) The profile should have a title describing its main purpose
			(like <code>Synchronizing my data directory between laptop
			and workstation</code>).</p>
		<p>(B2) The profile must include a list of directory pairs that
			should be compared and synchronized. We call the first member
			in this pair <i>source</i> and the second one <i>target</i>
			directory. But this is just for labeling the two. You are
			allowed to copy and delete files from the source directory to
			the target directory and vice versa. If you want to add a new
			pair, a directory explorer is opened and you may choose a source
			and target directory on your local file system.</p>
		<p>If you want to synchronize a local directory with a directory of
			an external computer, you have to access a network drive or use a
			WebDAV back end for
			synchronization. The easiest way is, to simply connect both
			computers (via a Local Area Network) and to make the
			directories of one of your machines available for the other one
			(e.g., by using Windows File System Sharing, Samba, or NFS).</p>
		<p>(B3) You may also specify the <a href="JFSSyncModes.html">
			synchronization mode</a>; i.e., the mode used in order to
			synchronize the specified pairs of directories. The default
			settings use the automatic mode that will use the history of
			synchronized files in order to determine whether a file should
			be copied or has to be deleted. You may also change the
			synchronization mode using the corresponding menu items of
			the JFileSync main frame.</p>
		<h2>Advanced Settings</h2>
		<p>In the following we describe more advanced profile settings.
			These options usually don't have to be modified.</p>
		<p>(A1) You may specify the granularity in ms for the comparison of
			two files or directories. Under the DOS and Windows FAT file
			system, the finest granularity on time resolution is two
			seconds. So we define the default maximum tolerance range for
			each comparison as 2000ms.</p>
		<p>(A2) You may specify the buffer size used for copying files. A
			buffer size of 262144 bytes is used by default.</p>
		<p>(A3) A user may set actions for each element of the synchronization
			table manually. If the flag for keeping user-defined actions is
			de-activated, such user-defined actions will be overwritten by the
			original actions when switching between synchronization modes. 
			The default behavior is to keep such user-defined actions.</p>
		<p>(A4) You may specify whether JFileSync stores histories of
			synchronized files. Per default histories are stored to the
			JFS configuration directory (usually <code>.jfs</code>,
			located in the user's home directory) for each synchronized
			directory pair. The histories are used to automatically
			determine files to copy and delete on source and/or target
			directory structures. Turning this off for a profile means
			that the automatic synchronization mode will not be able to
			determine synchronization actions based on the
			synchronization history.</p>
		<p>(A5) You may determine whether the can write property of a file
			should be replicated during synchronization. Per default a file
			is set read only, if no right access is granted. However, if the
			file is changed and would have to be synchronized, the can
			write property prohibits overwriting the target file if set.</p>
		<h2>Include and Exclude Filters</h2>
		<p>You may specify a list of regular expressions that should be used
			in order to determine whether a certain file or directory
			should be included/excluded in the comparison and
			synchronization to be performed. If the name of the file or
			directory matches the expression, it is
			included/excluded.</p>
		<p>Excluding expressions are stronger than including ones; that
			is, if a file or directory matches an include and exclude
			expression, it is excluded from comparison.</p>
		<p>For instance, if you want to exclude all files that use
			<code>xyz</code> as a file extension (like
			<code>test.xyz</code>) you may add <code>(.*)\.txt</code>
			as a regular expression to the list of exclude filters. In a
			regular expression the dot (<code>.</code>) represents an
			arbitrary character. If you want to specify the dot itself as a
			character you have to write a <code>\</code> in front of it.
			Brackets are just used for grouping purposes.</p>
		<h2>Server Options</h2>
		<p>You can change the options to access backend servers when not
		    only syncronizing local directories via the JFS
			server configuration panel as part of the profile management
			dialog..</p>
		<p>(S1) You may specify the base directory used on server side for
			finding files. This is the directory added as a parent
			directory to all files on server side. For instance, if you want
			to access a directory named <code>dir</code> on the server and
			the base directory is <code>/home/user</code>, the server is
			going to search for directory <code>/home/user/dir</code>
			on server side. The default directory is the current working
			directory (the directory from which the JFS server was
			started).</p>
		<p>(S2) You may specify a pass phrase used for accessing a JFS
			server. Only connections using this pass phrase for
			authentication are allowed to use the server. All other
			connections are rejected. It is highly recommended to change
			the pass phrase before using a JFS server.</p>
		<p>(S3) You may specify the standard port used by the JFS server (and
			used by a client to connect to the server).</p>
		<p>(S4) You may specify the timeout in ms used for all socket
			connections. The server is launched with a timeout of 5000 ms by
			default. If you are using a slow modem connection, you should
			increase this value to at least one minute (3600000 ms).</p>
		<p>(S5) You may specify whether a started JFS server is shut down by
			the JFS client as soon as the synchronization is done. If
			synchronizations have to run for a very long time, it may be
			convenient for security reasons to automatically shut down
			the server after synchronization.</p>
		<h2>Some Further Hints</h2>
		<p>In your profile, you can specify directory pairs that should
			match after synchronization. For instance, let us assume that
			the source directory is <code>C:\Source</code> and the
			target directory is <code>E:\Target</code>. That means, all
			files and directories in <code>C:\Source</code> are
			synchronized with all files and directories in
			<code>E:\Target</code>. It does not mean, that the source
			directory itself is copied to the target directory. The terms
			<i>source</i> and <i>target</i> are just for labeling two
			directories that should be synchronized; that means, should
			contain the same files after synchronization.</p>
		<p>You may modify existing directory pairs via the profile manager
			itself. Just do a double-click on the source or target
			directory's name in the table of directory pairs and modify the
			directory name accordingly. JFileSync should then ask you for
			creating a new directory, if the one you entered does not exist.
			Non-existing directories are written in red color. If you
			specify a directory located on a JFS server, no such tests are
			performed in order to avoid connecting to the server each time
			you change a member of a directory pair. External directories
			are written in blue color.</p>
