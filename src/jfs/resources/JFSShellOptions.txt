JFileSync Shell Commands:

  sync     Starts the synchronization according to the current list
           of copy and delete statements.

  t        Shows the results of the comparison of all specified
           directory pairs in form of a single table. The entries
           shown in the table depend on the specified view.

  c        Shows the current list of copy statements. If a
           certain line number is marked ('X') the copy statement
           is performed during the synchronization, otherwise it
           will be skipped.

  d        Shows the current list of delete statements. If a
           certain line number is marked ('X') the delete statement
           is performed during the synchronization, otherwise it
           will be skipped.

  c <Number>
           Toggles the copy statement with line number <Number>
           in the list of copy statements; i.e., if the line is
           marked (this is the default state) the copy statement
           is performed, if not the statement is skipped.

  d <Number>
           Toggles the delete statement with line number <Number>
           in the list of delete statements; i.e., if the line is
           marked (this is the default state) the delete statement
           is performed, if not the statement is skipped.

  sync <mode>
           Sets the number of the synchronization mode. All
           available and valid numbers are documented in the
           program's help system.

  view <mode>
           Sets the number of the current view. All available
           and valid view numbers are documented in the
           program's help system.

  help     Shows this screen of JFileSync Shell Commands.

  exit     Quits the JFileSync Shell without synchronization.
