Usage:

  JFileSync [options] | <configuration profile>

Options:

  You can use the following options in any combination and sequence.
  However, for some options it doesn't make sense to use them twice
  or even more.

  Basic Settings:

  -config <profile>
           Loads a JFS configuration profile stored in <profile>. Any other
           options specified so far will be overwritten with the options
           specified in the configuration file. However, any options
           specified after loading the profile will change the loaded
           options.

  -sync <mode>
           Sets the number of the synchronization mode. All
           available and valid numbers are documented in the
           program's help system (available via the GUI).

  -view <mode>
           Sets the number of the current view. All available
           and valid view numbers are documented in the
           program's help system (available via the GUI).

  -dir <source> <target>
           Specifies a pair of directories that should be
           compared. All files and directories in the <source>
           directory are compared (and synchronized) with the 
           files and directories in the <target> directory.
           If you use this option twice or more times all specified
           directory pairs will be compared (and synchronized).

  Advanced Settings:

  -granularity <value>
           Sets the granularity of the comparison in milliseconds
           which is used in order to compare the last modification
           times of two files.
           Under the DOS and Windows FAT file system, the finest
           granularity is two seconds. So we define the default
           maximum tolerance range for each comparison as 2000ms.

  -buffersize <value>
           Sets the buffer size used. If this value is not specified
           a buffer size of 262144 bytes is used by default.

  -overwriteuseractions
           A user may set actions for each element of the synchronization
           table manually. If this flag is used, such user-defined actions
           are overwritten by the original actions when switching between 
           synchronization modes. The default behavior is to keep such
           user-defined actions.

  -nohistory
           This option turns off storing histories of synchronized files.
           Per default histories are stored to the JFS configuration
           directory (usually ".jfs", located in the user's home directory)
           for each synchronized directory pair. They are used to
           automatically determine files to copy and delete on source and/or
           target directory structures.

  -nowriteprotection
           This option determines whether the can write property of a file
           should be replicated during synchronization. Per default a file
           is set read only, if no right access is granted. However, if the
           file is changed and would have to be synchronized, the can
           write property prohibits overwriting the target file if set.

  -debug   This option turns on the debug mode which is disabled by
           default. This mode is just for testing and evaluation purposes
           and may or may not change your files consistently. It should
           not be activated unless you are debugging the application.
           
  Include and Exclude Filters:

  -include <expression> [<property> [<objects>]]
           Specifies a regular expression that should be used in order to
           determine whether a certain file or directory should be
           included in the performed comparison. If the property (name or path)
           of the object (file or directory) matches the expression, it is
           included.
           You may apply the filter to the following properties:
           - 'name': the name of the file or directory (e.g., 'test.txt').
           - 'path': the path of the file or directory including source or
             target path (e.g., '/my-source-dir/files/text/test.txt').
           - 'relative_path': the relative path of the file or directory
             excluding source or target path (e.g., 'files/text/test.txt').
           By default, the 'name' property is checked.
           You may apply the filter to the following objects:
           - 'all': all objects including files and directories.
           - 'directories': includes directories exclusively.
           - 'files': includes files exclusively.
           By default, 'all' objects are checked.

  -exclude <expression> [<property> [<objects>]]
           Specifies a regular expression that should be used in order to
           determine whether a certain file or directory should be
           excluded in the performed comparison. If the property (name or path)
           of the object (file or directory) matches the expression, it is
           excluded. Excluding expressions are stronger than including ones;
           that is, if a file or directory matches an include and exclude
           expression, it is excluded from comparison.
           Please see the description of include filters for allowed properties
           and objects.

  Additional Command Line Options:

  -nogui   Starts the program without Graphical User Interface; i.e., 
           performs the comparison and synchronization according to 
           the specified options. The command line interface provided
           allows to access all synchronization functionality.
           It is possible to interrupt the comparison and
           synchronization by pressing 'return' during the state of
           progress is displayed.

  -quiet   If the program is started without GUI (Option '-nogui') it
           will start a simple shell after the comparison of your
           specified directory pairs (Option '-dir').
           If this option is specified, it will perform the
           synchronization at once without starting the shell.

  -laf [<value>]
           If no value is provided, this option lists all installed
           GUI look and feels and their corresponding Java class names.
           These names can be used as a value in order to apply a specific
           look and feel. Once specified, this value is stored in the
           application's settings. If you want to use a different look and
           feel class that is part of an external library you may start JFS
           as follows:
             java -cp <JFS library><separator><LaF library>
               jfs.JFileSync -laf <LaF class>

  -help, -?
           Displays this command line help message.

  -version The version of the application.
