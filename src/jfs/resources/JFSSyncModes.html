		<h1>Available Synchronization Modes</h1>
		<p>The default setting uses the automatic mode that will use the
			history of synchronized files in order to determine whether a
			file should be copied or has to be deleted. However, you may also
			force JFileSync to create an exact copy of one file system
			ignoring whether a file on one side is newer than its
			corresponding file. The following synchronization modes are
			supported by JFileSync:</p>
		<h2>Automatic</h2>
		<p>The synchronization history is used to determine whether to
			delete or copy files. Example 1: If a file exists on target side
			and matches a previously synchronized file stored in the
			synchronization history, but does not exist on source side
			(any more), the user has deleted the file on source side after
			the last synchronization. In this case, the file on the target
			side will be deleted, so that both file structured will match
			after the synchronization. Example 2: If a file on source side
			is newer than a file on target side and the file on target side
			matches a previously synchronized file stored in the
			synchronization history, the file on source side will be
			copied to the target side. Example 3: If no synchronization
			history is available for a file, the user will be asked when two
			matching files exist having a different time stamp. In this
			case the source and target files may have been added and
			modified after the last synchronization and it would be
			impossible to determine automatically which file to
			copy.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this mode is <code>9</code> when using it from
			the command line.</p>
		<h2>Merge File Structures</h2>
		<p>All more up-to-date files and directories on source side will be
			copied to the target side and vice versa. If a file or directory
			is missing on source side, it will be copied from target side and
			vice versa. No files or directories will be deleted at all. The
			file system structures will simply be merged; no
			synchronization history will be used.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this mode is <code>10</code> when using it
			from the command line.</p>
		<h2>Transfer Source Files</h2>
		<p>Only more up-to-date files and directories existing on the
			source side will be copied to the target side. If a file or
			directory is missing on the target side, it will be copied from
			the source side. No files or directories will be deleted at all
			and no synchronization history will be used.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this mode is <code>11</code> when using it
			from the command line.</p>
		<h2>Transfer Target Files</h2>
		<p>Only more up-to-date files and directories existing on the
			target side will be copied to the source side. If a file or
			directory is missing on the source side, it will be copied from
			the target side. No files or directories will be deleted at all
			and no synchronization history will be used.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this mode is <code>12</code> when using it
			from the command line.</p>
		<h2>Transfer Source Structure</h2>
		<p>Only more up-to-date files and directories existing on the
			source side will be copied to the target side. If a file or
			directory is missing on the target side, it will be copied from
			the source side. If a file or directory on the target side
			doesn't exist on the source side, it will be deleted from the
			target side. No files or directories on the source side will be
			deleted at all and no synchronization history will be
			used.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this mode is <code>13</code> when using it
			from the command line.</p>
		<h2>Transfer Target Structure</h2>
		<p>Only more up-to-date files and directories existing on the
			target side will be copied to the source side. If a file or
			directory is missing on the source side, it will be copied from
			the target side. If a file or directory on the source side
			doesn't exist on the target side, it will be deleted from the
			source side. No files or directories on the target side will be
			deleted at all and no synchronization history will be
			used.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this mode is <code>14</code> when using it
			from the command line.</p>
		<h2>Transfer Common Files</h2>
		<p>Only files and directories that exist on both sides will be
			synchronized according to their time stamp. If a file or
			directory on the source side is more up-to-date than it's
			counterpart on the target side, it will be copied from the
			source side and vice versa. No files or directories will be
			deleted at all and no synchronization history will be
			used.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this mode is <code>15</code> when using it
			from the command line.</p>
		<h2>Force Source Structure</h2>
		<p>All newer and even older files and directories from the source
			side will be copied to the target side. All files not existing on
			the source side will be deleted from the target side. That
			means, if a file on the target side is newer than the file on the
			source side, it will be overwritten with the older file. No
			files or directories on the source side will be deleted at all
			and no synchronization history will be used.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this mode is <code>16</code> when using it
			from the command line.</p>
		<h2>Force Target Structure</h2>
		<p>All newer and even older files and directories from the target
			side will be copied to the source side. All files not existing on
			the target side will be deleted from the source side. That
			means, if a file on the source side is newer than the file on the
			target side, it will be overwritten with the older file. No
			files or directories on the target side will be deleted at all
			and no synchronization history will be used.</p>
		<p>The identifier of this mode is <code>17</code> when using it
			from the command line.</p>
